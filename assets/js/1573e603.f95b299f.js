A few additional things to consider: - If you try to build it yourself, Unreal does not provide you with any servers. You have to find a cloud platform. - Unity also has a WebRTC based streaming plugin like Unreal that was recently released, but it is in the same boat as Unreal right now - you are not provided with servers or a scalable platform.

WebGL is less robust, limited in what you can do with publishing 3D applications as models will be lower in fidelity. Simple models that are fairly lightweight are okay for WebGL i.e. a shoe, jewelry, etc. However, high fidelity models and graphic intensive game projects are not supported by WebGL.
