:::info
**MetaClient** allows you to run the Pixel Streaming Server for Unreal Engine, instead of the usual complicated procedure [(STUN and TURN Servers)
](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/getting-started-with-pixel-streaming-in-unreal-engine/).

Get up and running streaming an Unreal Engine application from one computer to other computers and mobile devices on the same network.

And also, you can publish your project to [MetaCloud](../metacloud/description.md) for free in a couple of clicks.
