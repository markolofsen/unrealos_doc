## How to add a command

1. [Choose a project on MertaPortal](https://portal.metaeditor.io/user/projects/) and add a new command.

2. Each added command receives a uuid tag, which serves as a shortcut to invoke the command from MetaEditor.

3. All added commands are displayed in the developer panel.

## How to find the uuid shortcut?

1. In the list of commands in the developer panel, click on the subtitle
   (example `camera_zoom #2c2453`)

2. The copied label can be invoked via [metaEmitAsync](../metaeditor/methods/commands.md)
