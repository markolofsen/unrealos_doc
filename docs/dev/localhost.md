### To connect to a Pixel Streaming server running on a localhost, there is no need to download and install MetaEditor.

You can use the web version by connecting via a special link for local development: http://ps-local.metaeditor.io/dev

Please note that your local Pixel Streaming server does not use SSL certificates, so the connection to http://ps-local.metaeditor.io/dev must be strictly via the `http` protocol (not `https`).


### Default connection data:

* Host: `http://127.0.0.1`
* Port: `80`
