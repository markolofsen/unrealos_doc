> (Chrome performs best)

> Mobile. Mobile Chrome (Android 7+) and Mobile Safari (iOS 12+).

### Supported Resolutions

> Up to 1080p (720p recommended for better performance).

> By default resolution dynamically changed to be that of browser window size.

### Bandwidth Requirements

> Minimum of 5 Mbps bandwidth recommended per user / stream

### Performance

> Streaming framerate (fps) is dependent on game complexity (polygon count, lighting, particle effects, etc.), as well as the clientâ€™s browser resolution, network latency, bandwidth, and hardware specification.

> On intracontinental network links, average frame rates between 30 and 60 fps are typical when streaming multi-million polygon models at 720p to commodity grade end user devices (between 20 and 40 fps for 1080p).

### Cloud Service
